Configuration
=============

Ahcore is configured using Hydra. In the ahcore main folder there is a folder `config`,
these contain the standard configuration files. The configuration files are in YAML format according
to the Hydra specification.

If you want to add your own configuration files, you can do so by creating a new folder in the `additional_config`
folder. The configuration files here will override the standard configuration files.
