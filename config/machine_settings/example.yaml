# @package _global_

# In this file you can override machine / partition specific parameters
# This allows you to change machine_settings=your_machine to align with the computational availability
# Note that the @package _global_ on top is important; this allows you to override in the main config

# Note that machine settings are excluded from version control

# Example for datamodule:

datamodule:
  num_workers: 1
  batch_size: 16
